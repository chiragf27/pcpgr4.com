<p>HDD actuator is a device which moves head arm assembly. Its task is, not only to start and secure continuous movement of hard drive head assembly, but also to fully control it. Securing and control of this movement is of crucial importance for performing elementary function of hard drives.</p>
<p>Surface area of HDD platters is divided into large (and increasing) number of sectors for data storage.  Actuator brings head arm and its sliders to the right spot over HDD platters, from where data should be read/or where new data should be written. At the same time, electronic controller manage HDD motor operation. Platters are set in position so that firstly actuator, and then sliders, are able to perform their task.</p>
<p>If you consider platters RPM (up to 15000, usually 5400/7200) and the number of sectors which is "packed" on the platters of modern hard drives, it's clear how complex is task of HDD actuators in locating exact sector almost instantaneously.</p>
