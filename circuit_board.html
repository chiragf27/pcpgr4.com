<p>A hard disk circuit board is a board that controls many aspects of a hard disk, and it is made specifically for each hard disk. This board's specificity means each one will have certain firmware that uniquely suits it for that disk, though many hard disks may use the same firmware. <b>This circuit board is responsible for controlling power, ensuring that the hard disk is running and that it has enough energy to save data.</b> Another way this controls the hard disk is by telling the hard disk how to move the spindle and what platter to use.</p>
<p>Firmware, or permanent programming, is added to a hard disk circuit board to control the related hard disk. This firmware is responsible for telling the circuit board what to do, so it properly commands the hard disk. There are many types of hard disk firmware dependent on brand, programming type and version number. Each firmware is different, and mixing firmware can be dangerous for the hard disk and the computer as a whole.</p>
