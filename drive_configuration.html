<h1>Drive Configuration Port</h1><hr><font size="+2">
<p>The hard drive is the component that stores your data</p>
<p>There are three different kinds of hard drives:
<ul>
	<li>SATA Drives: <b>SATA stands for Serial Advanced Technology Attachement.</b> These are refered to as SATA hard drives, but they are actually rotary hard drives with spinning platters and a moving needle that writes data to consecutive sectors on each platter. SATA hard drives are incredibly fast compared to their predecessor, the PATA hard drive.</li><br>
	<li>SDD Hard Drives:<b> SSD stands for Solid State Drive.</b> These disks don't have any moving parts. Instead, all of the data is stored on non-volatile flash memory. That means that there isn't a needle that has to move to read or write data and that they are significantly faster than SATA drives.</li><br>
	<li>NVMe: Non-Volatile Memory Express, or NVMe, is a type of SSD that's attached to a PCI Express (PCIe) slot on a main board. These slots were originally designed for graphics cards, so they are incredibly fast.</li>
