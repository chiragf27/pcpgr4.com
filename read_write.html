<h1>Read/Write Head</h1>
<font size="+2">
The read/write head reads from and writes to a round hard disk platter that is housed in the physical drive container. Unlike the disk platter, the actual read/write head is extremely small. In modern disks these parts are designed down to the nanoscale. Simpler read/write heads were eventually replaced with metal-in-gap (MIG) heads, and then by thin-film heads that use different manufacturing processes to create smaller equipment.<br>
<br>These innovations were part of what led to greater storage capacity for hard disk drives. In addition to advanced design for read/write heads, modern data storage technologies also involve alternatives that work differently. For instance, solid-state data storage involves changes to electrical polarity that do not involve an actual disk arm and read/write head. In addition, there have been advances in new laser data transfer that use laser technology instead of the physical disk infrastructure that includes read/write heads and disk platters.
