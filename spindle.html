<p><b>A spindle is a shaft that holds rotating hard disk drive (HDD) platters in place. </b>The term is also often used to refer to a single HDD. Spindle speed, measured in <i>rotations per minute </i>(RPM), is one metric used to gauge disk drive performance.</p>
<p>Spindle speed can affect seek time, which is the speed at which a drive can locate a single bit of information, as well as the sustained rate at which data can be read from, or written to, a disk.</p>
<p>A post that holds a reel of magnetic tape or CDs. The picture shows an example of a blank CD spindle. When purchasing blank discs, they are often sold in a spindle like the one shown to the right. In the case of a hard drive, the spindle (shown below) is what holds the hard drive's platters in place. With a traditional hard drive, there is the need to have multiple platters. The spindle holds these platters in a fixed position with enough space for the read/write arms to get to the data on the disks</p>
