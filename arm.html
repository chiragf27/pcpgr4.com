<p>Arm is alternatively referred to as read/ write head arm, head arm, or actuator arm, the access arm in every mechanical hard dive: similar in apperance to the arm of a record player. As the platter spins, the access arm adjusts the read/write heads to facilitate the reading, writing, or deletion of information.</p>
