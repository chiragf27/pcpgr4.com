<p>When the platter rotates, the heads record data in tracks. A 3.5-inch hard disk can contain about thousand tracks.</p>
<p>The spindle holds the platters in a fixed position such that it is feasible for the read/write arms to get the data on the disks. These platters rotate at a constant speed while the drive head, positioned close to the center of the disk, reads the data slowly from the surface of the disk compared to the outer edges of the disk. To maintain integrity of data, the head is reading at a particular period of time from any drive head position. The tracks at the outer edges of the disk have less densely populated sectors compared to the tracks close to the center of the disk.</p>
