<hr>
</h1>
<p>A hard disk drive (HDD), hard disk, hard drive, or fixed disk is an electro-mechanical data storage device that stores and retrieves digital data using magnetic storage and one or more rigid rapidly rotating platters coated with magnetic material. The platters are paired with magnetic heads, usually arranged on a moving <u><a href=actuator.html>actuator</a></u> arm, which read and write data to the platter surfaces.  Data is accessed in a random-access manner, meaning that individual blocks of data can be stored and retrieved in any order. HDDs are a type of <u><a href=Non-volatile.html>non-volatile</a></u> storage, retaining stored data even when powered off.</p>

<h1>Characteristics of Hard Disk Drive</h1>
Some important characteristics of the hard disk are as follows:
<ul>
	<li>The hard disk provides a large storage capacity. The capacity of a personal computer hard disk is from 160 GB to 2TB and more.</li>
	<li>It is much faster than the floppy disk.</li>
	<li>It is the primary media for storing data and programs.</li>
	<li>It is more reliable than a floppy disk.</li>
	<li>Data stored on the hard disk is safer than the <u><a href="floppy disk.html">floppy disk.</a></u></li>
</ul>

<h3>Why does a computer need a hard drive?</h3>
<p>A computer requires an operating system to allow users to interact with and use it. The operating system interprets keyboard and mouse movements and allows for the use of software, like an Internet browser, word processor, and video games. To install a computer operating system, a hard drive (or another storage device) is required. The storage device provides the storage medium where the operating system is installed and stored. A hard drive is also required for the installation of any programs or other files you want to keep on your computer. When downloading files to your computer, they are permanently stored on your hard drive or another storage medium until they are moved or uninstalled.</p>
