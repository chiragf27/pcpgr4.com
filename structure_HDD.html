<p><b>A hard disk contains a stack of platters, circular metal disks that are mounted inside the hard disk drive and coated with magnetic material, sealed in a metal case or unit. Fixed in a horizontal or vertical position, the hard disk has electromagnetic read or write heads above and below the platters.</b> The surface of the disk consists of a number of concentric rings called as tracks; each of these tracks has smaller partitions called disk blocks. The size of each disk block is 512 bytes (0.5 KB). The track numbering starts with zero.</p>
<p>The disk fills the space based on a standard plan. One side of the first platter contains space, reserved for hardware track-positioning information which is not available to the operating system. The disk controller uses the track-positioning information to place the drive heads in the correct sector position.</p>
<p>The disk is divided into tracks. Each track is further divided into sectors. The point to be noted here is that outer tracks are bigger in size than the inner tracks but they contain the same number of sectors and have equal storage capacity. This is because the storage density is high in sectors of the inner tracks whereas the bits are sparsely arranged in sectors of the outer tracks. Some space of every sector is used for formatting. So, the actual capacity of a sector is less than the given capacity.</p>
