A USB port is a standard cable connection interface for personal computers  and consumer electronics devices. USB stands for Universal Serial Bus, an industry standard for short-distance digital data communications. USB ports allow USB devices to be connected to each other with and transfer digital data over USB cables. They can also supply electric power across the cable to devices that need it.

Both wired and wireless versions of the USB standard exist, although only the wired version involves USB ports and cables.
